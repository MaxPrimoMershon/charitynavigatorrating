# Charity Navigator Rating


## Overview:
Data has slowly entered the non-profit sector over the past couple of decade with the raise of impact investing. Investors/donors are now demanding more proof of impact and transparency from organizations. Charity Navigator has long been regarded as the leading independent evaluator of non-profits. They produce their own ratings for charities based on a variety of financial performance, accountability and transparency information. Personally, I am curious as to how each factor weighs into the overall rating they calculate. I’m essentially attempting to reverse engineer their model.

## Question:
What is the impact of the different non-profit metrics on Charity Navigator’s “Overall Rating”?
