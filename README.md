# Charity Navigator Rating


## Overview
Data has slowly entered the non-profit sector over the past few decades with the raise of impact investing. Investors/donors are now demanding more proof of impact and transparency from organizations. Charity Navigator has long been regarded as the leading independent evaluator of non-profits. They produce their own ratings for charities based on a variety of financial performance, accountability and transparency information. Personally, I am curious as to how well the latest and greatest machine learning algotrithms can reverse engineer their rating methodology in order to determine the impact of the different metrics they collect on the overall rating.

## Question
What is the impact of the different non-profit metrics on Charity Navigator’s “Overall Rating”?
